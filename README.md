# Mid-Air Gesture For Multi-Finger Control System Using Leap Motion Robot

![Leap Motion Robot](insert_image_url_here)

## Overview

The proposed system aims to revolutionize human interaction with electric devices by enabling seamless touch-free control through mid-air gestures using the Leap Motion Controller. This README provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, features, technologies used, and how to get started.

## Features

- Seamless interaction with electric devices through mid-air gestures.
- Accurate hand tracking and multi-finger control using the Leap Motion Controller.
- Integration of IoT and embedded technologies for communication between human hand and electric devices.
- Potential application in home automation, manufacturing, healthcare, and space exploration.

## Technologies Used

- Leap Motion Controller
- Arduino (for controlling Roker bogie)
- IoT and embedded technologies
- Machine learning for gesture recognition and personalized control experience

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (list them if any).
3. Connect the Leap Motion Controller and Arduino board to your computer.

## Usage

To use the system:

1. Run the project_swipe application.
2. Ensure the Leap Motion Controller is properly calibrated and positioned.
3. Perform mid-air gestures to control the electric devices.
4. Refer to the documentation for a list of supported gestures and commands.

## Project Structure

- **arduino_code:** Contains the Arduino code for controlling the Roker bogie.
- **project_swipe:** Main application for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
